## üå± Getting Started

1. **Clone & install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakejarvis/hoot.git
   cd hoot
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start local Redis (optional but recommended):**  
   For local development with caching and screenshot features, start Redis with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This starts a Redis server and Upstash-compatible REST proxy at `http://localhost:8079`.

3. **Configure `.env.local`:**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   For local development with docker-compose Redis:
   ```env
   KV_REST_API_URL=http://localhost:8079
   KV_REST_API_TOKEN=local_dev_token
   ```
   
   See `.env.example` for other optional credentials (UploadThing for favicon/screenshot storage, Mapbox for maps, PostHog for analytics).

4. **Start the dev server:**  
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
