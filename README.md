# ü¶â Hoot - Domain Intelligence Tool

[Hoot.sh](https://hoot.sh) is a all-in-one app for exploring domain names. Easily search for any domain (like [`github.com`](https://hoot.sh/github.com)) and get instant insights including WHOIS info, DNS records, SSL certificates, HTTP headers, hosting details, and geolocation.

## üå± Getting Started

1. **Clone & install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jakejarvis/hoot.git
   cd hoot
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the dev server:**  
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

3. **(Optional) Configure `.env.local`:**  
   See `.env.example` for Redis and UploadThing credentials (needed for caching and favicon/screenshot features).

## üîÑ v2 Cutover: Postgres + Drizzle + Inngest

- **Primary store**: Postgres (Neon). All domain sections persist to tables in `server/db/schema.ts` via Drizzle.
- **Drizzle**: Schema/migrations in `drizzle/`. Config in `drizzle.config.ts`. Client at `server/db/client.ts`.
- **Redis role**: Short-lived locks, rate limiting, and image/report caches only (no primary data). See `lib/cache.ts`, `lib/report-cache.ts`.
- **Background jobs (Inngest)**:
  - `app/api/inngest/route.ts` serves functions.
  - `section-revalidate`: re-fetch a section for a domain.
  - `domain-inspected`: fans out per-section revalidation.
  - `scan-due`: cron to enqueue revalidations for stale rows.
- **TTL & freshness**: Policies in `server/db/ttl.ts`. Each service reads from Postgres first and revalidates when stale.
- **Services**: `server/services/*` now read/write Postgres via repos in `server/repos/*`.

### Environment
- `DATABASE_URL` (required)
- Redis/UploadThing/PostHog remain as before (see `.env.example`).

### Commands
```bash
# Drizzle
pnpm drizzle:generate
pnpm drizzle:migrate

# Dev / checks / tests
pnpm dev
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:run
```

### Notes
- Provider catalog is seeded from `lib/providers/rules/*` via `server/db/seed/providers.ts`.
- Trigram search enabled via `pg_trgm` migration in `drizzle/`.
- No back-compat/migration from Redis snapshots; v2 is a clean switch.
